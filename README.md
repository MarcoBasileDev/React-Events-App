This React application allows users to create, delete, modify, and search events by specifying their name, location, description, and time. The main focus of the project, however, is not solely to create an events application, but rather to learn how to utilize the Tanstack library, specifically React Query. This involves understanding how to configure query behavior, manage cache and state data, configure query objects, abort requests, enable/disable queries, cache data with mutations, and implement automatic refetching.
